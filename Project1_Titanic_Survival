 **Titanic Survival Prediction - Logistic Regression Model**



 **OVERVIEW**  
This project uses machine learning to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The dataset includes demographic and travel-related information for each passenger. By cleaning the data and applying a Logistic Regression model, we aim to identify the key factors that influenced survival rates.



 **PROBLEM STATEMENT**  
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and family connections.  
This is a binary classification problem (Survived: 1 or 0).



 **FEATURES USED**

After data cleaning and feature engineering, the following features were used:

- **Pclass** – Passenger class  
- **Sex** – Encoded (male = 1, female = 0)  
- **Age** – Missing values filled with median  
- **SibSp** – Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- **Parch** – Number of parents/children aboard  
- **Fare** – Ticket fare  
- **Embarked** – Port: C = 0, Q = 1, S = 2  
- **Title** – Extracted from name and encoded  
- **FamilySize** – SibSp + Parch + 1  
- **IsAlone** – 1 if alone, 0 otherwise


 **DATA PREPROCESSING**

- Removed irrelevant columns: Cabin, PassengerId, Name, Ticket  
- Filled missing Age with median, and Embarked with mode  
- Extracted and encoded titles from names  
- Mapped categorical variables to numerical values  
- Scaled features using StandardScaler



 **TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED**

**Language:**  
Python

**Libraries:**  
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn



 **METHODOLOGY**

1. Data Cleaning and Exploration  
2. Feature Engineering  
3. Train-Test Split (80-20)  
4. Feature Scaling  
5. Logistic Regression Model Training  
6. Model Evaluation using:
   - Accuracy
   - Classification Report
   - Confusion Matrix  
7. Cross-Validation (cv = 5)  
8. Visualization of survival patterns

## **VISUALIZATION**

**Survival Count by Sex**  
A bar chart visualizing the number of male and female passengers who survived versus those who did not.  
(You can save the chart using `plt.savefig("visualization.png")` to display it in the repository.)

 **MODEL PERFORMANCE**

**Accuracy Score:** 78.7%  
**Cross-Validation Score (mean):** 81%



 **CONCLUSION**  
This Logistic Regression model effectively predicts survival using engineered features.  
Key influencers of survival include:  
- Gender  
- Ticket class  
- Whether the passenger was traveling alone
