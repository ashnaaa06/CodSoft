 **Sales Prediction using Random Forest Regression**



 **OVERVIEW**  
This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising budget across different media: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. By exploring the Advertising dataset and applying machine learning models, the project aims to determine which channels are most effective in driving sales.



 **PROBLEM STATEMENT**  
Given the budget allocation across various media, predict the corresponding sales figures. The objective is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate future sales based on advertising spend.



 **DATASET USED**  
**File:** advertising.csv  
**Attributes:**
- **TV** – Budget spent on TV advertising
- **Radio** – Budget spent on Radio advertising
- **Newspaper** – Budget spent on Newspaper advertising
- **Sales** – Target variable (Product sales in thousands of units)


 **FEATURES USED FOR MODELING**  
- TV  
- Radio  
- Newspaper  

These features were used as input variables (`X`) to predict the target variable `Sales`.



 **DATA PREPROCESSING AND EXPLORATION**
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`  
- Visualized correlation using a heatmap  
- Created scatter plots of each feature vs. sales  
- Checked for outliers using residual distribution plots



 **TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED**

**Language:**  
Python

**Libraries:**  
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, joblib



 **METHODOLOGY**

1. **Data Loading** – Read the advertising dataset using pandas  
2. **Data Visualization** – Correlation heatmap and scatter plots  
3. **Train-Test Split** – Split data into 80% training and 20% testing  
4. **Model Training** – Used the following models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluated models using R² Score, MSE, RMSE, MAE  
6. **Feature Importance** – Visualized most influential features  
7. **Residual Analysis** – Checked prediction errors  
8. **Model Export** – Saved the trained Random Forest model using `joblib`



 **VISUALIZATION OUTPUTS**

- Correlation heatmap  
- Feature importance bar plot  
- Residual distribution  
- Sales vs. Feature scatter plots  
- Actual vs Predicted Sales scatter plot



 **CONCLUSION**  
The Random Forest model performed the best among all evaluated models with high R² and low error rates.  
The **TV** and **Radio** advertising budgets were found to be the most significant predictors of sales, while **Newspaper** had less impact.
